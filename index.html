                    <p>I'm full-time manager and I had decided to change my carreer. My passion for coding started
                        with VBA. I liked the idea of writing a code, which changing the all perspective
                        of how the things can get done. Then I had decided that I will start exploring other 
                        languages.Then few years ago did my first free course about coding - the basics HTML and CSS.
                        It was interesting, but it was quite far from the things I want to do. Then I caught up with 
                        my work for few months. Sometime later I decided that I'll start learning again.
                        Then I went
                        for JavaScript, it was just for few weeks. Then moved to C++, I gave up. I wanted to learn coding,
                        but everything was so confused...I watched few youtube videos and then I realised that I need a lot 
                        of time. And now I'm working only 3 days a week, so I can code. I have a lot of ideas, that I'll turn
                        into real projects.
